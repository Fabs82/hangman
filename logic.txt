Project Hangman
--------------------------

**Game Logic

--- START THE GAME
1. Set the "player lives" to a number
2. Select a random word from the "words-list.txt" file 

--- START THE LOOP (while mistakes < 10)
3. Show the word with the letters hidden
4. Player chooses a letter of the alphabet
5. Check if the letter is in the word
5b. If YES: add the letter to the word and to a list of already_chosen letters (a letter can be chosen onyl once). ELSE mistakes count +1
6. Repeat the loop unless mistakes = 10 or word has been found


**Game Structure

PLAYER CLASS
Initialized with a simple name
It has a method that allows the player to choose a letter from the alphabet. It returns the letter

ALPHABET CLASS
Initialized with a list of the alphabet letters

WORD CLASS
Initialized with ?
It has a method that loads the "words-list.txt" file and chooses a random word from it

GAME CLASS
A list of the letters already chosen. A count of the mistakes. Tee chosen word (coming from the Word class)?
It has a method that manages the main loop of the game
A method that checks if the letter chosen by the player is in the word
A method that makes letters appear on the screen and adds them to the list of already_chosen
A method that checks if the game has ended (word found or player out of guesses)


**To do later when the game works has intended

At the start of any turn, instead of making a guess the player should also have the option to save the game.
When the program first loads, add in an option that allows you to open one of your saved games, and allow player to play on.
